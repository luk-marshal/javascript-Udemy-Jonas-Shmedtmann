# Course Material and FAQ for my Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Shmedtmann

This repo contains starter files and final code for all sections and projects contained in the course.

Use starter code to start each section, and **final code to compare it with your own code whenever something doesn't work**!


### Q5: Can I see a final version of the course projects?

**A:** Sure! Here you go:

- [Pig Game](https://pig-game-v2.netlify.app) (DOM Manipulation)
- [Bankist](https://bankist.netlify.app/) (Arrays, Numbers, Dates, Timers. Fake "log in" with user `js` and PIN `1111`)
- [Bankist Site](https://bankist-dom.netlify.app/) (Advanced DOM and Events)
- [Mapty](https://mapty.netlify.app/) (OOP, Geolocation, Project planning)
- [forkify](https://forkify-v2.netlify.app/) (Final advanced project)


### Q9: I want to put these projects in my portfolio. Is that allowed?

**A:** Absolutely! Just make sure you actually built them yourself by following the course, and that you understand what you did. What is **not allowed** is that you create your own course/videos/articles based on this course's content!

**A:** It's on my website at <http://codingheroes.io/resources>. You can subscribe for updates ðŸ˜‰
